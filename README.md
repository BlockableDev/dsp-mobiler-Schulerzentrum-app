# DSP Schuler Zentrum App

Welcome to the DSP School App, an all-in-one mobile application designed for students at the DSP school. This app is available for both Android and iOS devices, and it aims to make your school experience more convenient and efficient.

## Features
- UNTIS integration: Keep track of your classes, schedules, and grades all in one place.
- Unicard sign-in: Use your Unicard to easily choose your food in the school cantine.
- Microsoft teams sign-in: Open your Teams account in the web or native app version with our app.
- Refined official school website: Access the most important information about the school, such as news and events, in a user-friendly format.

## Note
As of now, the WebUntis integration in app is **not working**. The code and software all work as intended, but what causes this issue is something we cannot correct until **september 2023**. The problem occurs due to a core function needed for the usage of the WebUntis API in cordova not being enabled in the current WebUntis API version, we have gotten in contact with their support team and we have been lead to believe this error will be solved in the new upcoming version of the API, wich will be released in september this year. 

## Getting started
1. Download the app from the Google Play Store or the App Store.
2. Log in using your school credentials.
3. Start using the app to access your class schedules, choose your cantine food, and stay updated on school news and events.

## Future of the App
We plan on adding many new features as time goes on in our app and have already started working on some of them, but we will only release them after the Jugendforscht competition has ended.
Here is a list of all our upcoming features:
- Full release on the Play Store for android devices after the new WebUntis API release.
- Ported version for iOS devices.
- DSL app for the Deutsche Schule Lissabon, with Moodle integration and other personalised QOL features.
- **1 Password login**: this is a feature we are currently working on, wich will use the Database of our school (DSP), wich has an individual student profile system, to allow students to log in to all School related apps with only 1 Password using our app. This way student will only have to know their student account name and password and type them into our app, for it to automaticly log them into apps like teams, WebUntis and Unicard Sige with no forther steps. We have already spoken to the staff of our school and have the required access to make this possible in the future.

## Support
If you have any issues or questions about the app, please contact the IT department at the school.

## Contribution

## License
This project is under no license as of now, but may in the future get one from our school.
